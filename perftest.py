with numbers like that, it becomes clear that the walking itself it very
easy, but the wrapping of Match objects as Python objects is very expensive, to
the extent where a pure Python walk is faster than a C-backed walk, as we have
to pay overhead for callback with C backed version.

The solution for improving performance is to improve the wrapping function.
